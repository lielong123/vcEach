# PiCCANTE 🌶️

**Pi**CCANTE **C**ar **C**ontroller **A**rea **N**etwork **T**ool for **E**xploration

PiCCANTE is a powerful hacking tool for accessing, exploring, and manipulating vehicle CAN bus networks, built on the affordable Raspberry Pi Pico platform. Designed for researchers, security professionals, and automotive enthusiasts looking to dive deep into vehicle systems without expensive proprietary equipment.

## 🚧 WORK IN PROGRESS 🚧

## ℹ️ About PiCCANTE

PiCCANTE is designed to be a dead-**simple**, dirt-**cheap**, and readily-**available** hardware platform for vehicle research and exploration.  
As cars become more and more computerized, manufacturers keep locking them behind proprietary tools and restrictive systems, even connect vehicles to the internet, yet they still rely on communication standards from the 1980s.  
Car hacking and independent research grows increasingly important to discover security vulnerabilities, reverse engineer vehicle systems, and empower owners with custom tools for diagnostics and tuning that support the Right to Repair movement.

The project leverages Raspberry Pi Pico (2 [W]) development boards, selected for their exceptional affordability, global availability, impressive specifications, and well-documented open-source SDK.

⚠️ Always exercise caution when connecting to vehicle systems.

- 1-3× CAN transceivers (readily available SN65HVD23x or any other 3.3V compatible transceiver)
  - **Note:** Most readily available transceiver breakout-boards have a 120Ohm terminating Resistor on them, for research in a vehicle, you may need to remove it.
- USB cable
- Perfboard
  - [**OPTIONAL**] or custom PCB 🔜
- Soldering iron
- Basic soldering skills
- [**Optional**] Low dropout Buck-Converter module and OBD Plug for directly connecting to the vehicle's OBD-II port
- [**Optional**] 3D printed case for the Pico and transceivers

### 🚀 Basic Usage Examples

#### 🐧 Linux with can-utils (slcan)

```bash
# Set up SLCAN interface
sudo slcand -o -s6 -t hw -S 3000000 /dev/ttyACM1 can0
sudo ip link set up can0

# Monitor CAN traffic
candump can0
```

#### 🖥️ Cross Platform with SavvyCAN

1. Connect PiCCANTE to USB
2. Open SavvyCAN
3. Go to Connection ➡️ Open Connection Window ➡️ Add device Connection
4. Select "Serial Connection (GVRET)" and choose the appropriate COM port / TTY
5. Click "Create New Connection"

## 🔧 Hardware

Comprehensive documentation for self-built perfboard hardware is coming soon.  
Custom PCB designs may follow at a later date.

## 💾 Software

Pre-compiled binaries for all official Raspberry Pi Pico boards are available as CI action artifacts in the GitHub repository.

When connected via USB, PiCCANTE exposes **up to** 4× USB-CDC interfaces:

- 1× Combined PiCCANTE command + GVRET (binary) interface
  - Always the _first_ exposed CDC device.
  - Also exposed via telnet if enabled on WiFi enabled boards.
- **Up to** 3× SLCAN interfaces (dedicated to each CAN channel)

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### 🔄 Why only CAN2.0B and not CAN FD/XL?

The Raspberry Pi Pico has no native CAN support. The PIO can2040 implementation we're using only supports CAN 2.0B.  
However, if you **need** CAN FD or other bus types, feel free to open a PR supporting a CAN controller (like MCP2518FD).

### 🔌 Can I use PiCCANTE with Linux/Windows/macOS?

Yes! PiCCANTE is designed to be cross-platform. It works with any operating system as a standard USB device with no special drivers required.  
For SLCAN interfaces, Linux users can use can-utils to provide a SocketCAN interface, while all platforms support the GVRET/SLCAN interface through tools like SavvyCAN.

### 💻 How many CAN buses can I monitor simultaneously?

Up to 3 CAN buses on the RP2350 (Pico 2/2W) and up to 2 CAN buses on the RP2040 (original Pico/Pico W).  
Each bus has a dedicated USB-CDC SLCAN interface.

### 🔧 Why build my own instead of buying a commercial CAN adapter?

PiCCANTE gives you a fully open-source solution at a fraction of the cost of commercial tools.  
You get complete control over the hardware and software, the ability to customize for specific needs, and valuable learning experience about CAN networks and embedded systems.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

- **Issue**: CAN bus not receiving data  
  *Solutions*:  
  - Verify CAN status with `can_status` command
  - Verify wiring and bitrate settings
  - Check for proper bus termination resistance (remove resistor on the transceiver if connected to an existing CAN-bus)

- **Issue**: LED not lighting up / blinking  
  *Solutions*:
  - Check USB connection and power
  - Check led_mode command on the first USB CDC device
