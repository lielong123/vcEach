# PiCCANTE 🌶️

**Pi**ccante **C**ar **C**ontroller **A**rea **N**etwork **T**ool for **E**xploration

PiCCANTE is a powerful tool for exploring and reversing CAN busses of vehicles, based on Raspberry Pi Pico (any model)

## 🚧 WORK IN PROGRESS 🚧

## ℹ️ About PiCCANTE

PiCCANTE is designed to be a dead-**simple**, dirt-**cheap**, and readily-**available** hardware platform for vehicle research and exploration.  
As the automotive landscape becomes increasingly connected, while still relying on communication standards from the 1980s, independent vehicle research is becoming increasingly important.

The project leverages Raspberry Pi Pico (2 [W]) development boards, selected for their exceptional affordability, global availability, impressive specifications, and well-documented open-source SDK.

⚠️ Always exercise caution when connecting to vehicle systems.

### 🎯 Core Goals

- **Dead-simple**:
  - Simple enough to be soldered on perfboard with minimal components
- **Dirt-cheap**:
  - Minimal hardware requirements keep costs down
  - Based on affordable, off-the-shelf components
  - No specialty hardware needed
- **Readily-Available**:
  - Fully open-source hardware and software
  - Uses widely available Raspberry Pi Pico boards as base
- **Easy to use**:
  - Pre-built firmware releases available for immediate use
  - *Driverless* across all major operating systems
  - Seamless integration with existing CAN tools
  - 🔜 Documentation

### ✨ Features

- ✅ Up to 3× CAN 2.0B interfaces (2× on RP2040 (Pico[W]), 3× on RP2350 (Pico 2[W]))
- ✅ 1× USB-CDC PiCCANTE command + GVRET (binary only) interface
  - Compatible with [SavvyCAN](https://github.com/collin80/SavvyCAN) and other automotive tools
- ✅ Up to 3× USB-CDC SLCAN interfaces (dedicated to each CAN channel)
  - SocketCAN compatible via [can-utils (Linux)](https://github.com/linux-can/can-utils)
- 🔜 ELM327 emulator
- 🔜 WiFi / Bluetooth support (on Pico W models)
- 🔜 MITM mode for advanced analysis / vehicle tuning
- 🔜 Data logging to SD card (maybe)
- 🔜 3D printable case designs for making PiCCANTE based OBD-II dongles

## 📋 Quick Start

### What You'll Need

- 1× Raspberry Pi Pico (any model, RP2040 or RP2350)
  - **Note:** The Pico 2 W (RP2350) is recommended for full feature support, including WiFi and Bluetooth.
- 1-3× CAN transceivers (readily available SN65HVD23x or any other 3.3V compatible transceiver)
  - **Note:** Most readily available transceiver breakout-boards have a 120Ohm terminating Resistor on them, for research in a vehicle, you may need to remove it.
- USB cable
- Perfboard
  - [**OPTIONAL**] or custom PCB 🔜
- Soldering iron
- Basic soldering skills
- [**Optional**] Low dropout Buck-Converter module and OBD Plug for directly connecting to the vehicle's OBD-II port
- [**Optional**] 3D printed case for the Pico and transceivers

### Basic Usage Examples

#### Linux with can-utils (slcan)

```bash
# Set up SLCAN interface
sudo slcand -o -s6 -t hw -S 3000000 /dev/ttyACM1 can0
sudo ip link set up can0

# Monitor CAN traffic
candump can0
```

#### Cross Platform with SavvyCAN

1. Connect PiCCANTE to USB
2. Open SavvyCAN
3. Go to Connection ➡️ Open Connection Window ➡️ Add device Connection
4. Select "Serial Connection (GVRET)" and choose the appropriate COM port / TTY
5. Click "Create New Connection"

## 🔧 Hardware

Comprehensive documentation for self-built perfboard hardware is coming soon.  
Custom PCB designs may follow at a later date.

## 💾 Software

Pre-compiled binaries for all official Raspberry Pi Pico boards are available as CI action artifacts in the GitHub repository.

When connected via USB, PiCCANTE exposes **up to** 4× USB-CDC interfaces:

- 1× PiCCANTE command + GVRET (binary) interface
- **Up to** 3× SLCAN interfaces (dedicated to each CAN channel)

### PiCCANTE Commands

```
binary          - Toggle GVRET binary mode (binary <on|off>)
can_bitrate     - Change CAN bus bitrate (can_bitrate <bus> <bitrate>)
can_disable     - Disable CAN bus (can_disable <bus>)
can_enable      - Enable CAN bus with specified bitrate (can_enable <bus> <bitrate>)
can_status      - Show status of CAN buses
echo            - Toggle command echo (echo <on|off>)
help            - Display this help message
led_mode        - Set LED mode (led_mode <0-2>) 0=OFF, 1=Power, 2=CAN Activity
log_level       - Set log level (log_level <0-3>). 0=DEBUG, 1=INFO, 2=WARNING, 3=ERROR
reset           - Reset the system (reset)
save            - Save current settings to flash
set_num_busses  - Set number of CAN buses (can_num_busses [number])
settings        - Show current system settings
sys_stats       - Display system information and resource usage (sys_stats [cpu|heap|fs|tasks|uptime])
```

## ❓ Troubleshooting

- **Issue**: CAN bus not receiving data  
  *Solutions*:  
  - Verify CAN status with `can_status` command
  - Verify wiring and bitrate settings
  - Check for proper bus termination resistance (remove resistor on the transceiver if connected to an existing CAN-bus)

- **Issue**: LED not blinking  
  *Solution*:
  - Check USB connection and power
